	 * (Science: wind-chill temperature) How cold is it outside? The temperature
	 * alone is not enough to provide the answer. Other factors including wind
	 * speed, rela- tive humidity, and sunshine play important roles in determining
	 * coldness outside. In 2001, the National Weather Service (NWS) implemented the
	 * new wind-chill temperature to measure the coldness using temperature and wind
	 * speed. 
	 * 
	 * The formula is t wc = 35.74 + 0.6215t a - 35.75v 0.16 + 0.4275t a v
	 * 0.16 where t a is the outside temperature measured in degrees Fahrenheit and
	 * v is the speed measured in miles per hour. t wc is the wind-chill
	 * temperature. 
	 * 
	 * The formula cannot be used for wind speeds below 2 mph or
	 * temperatures below -58 oF or above 41oF. Write a program that prompts the
	 * user to enter a temperature between -58 oF and 41oF and a wind speed greater
	 * than or equal to 2 and displays the wind-chill tem- perature. Use Math.pow(a,
	 * b) to compute v 0.16 . Here is a sample run:
