/**
 * (Science: day of the week) Zellerâ€™s congruence is an algorithm developed by
 * Christian Zeller to calculate the day of the week. The formula is :
 * 
 * h=(q+((13*(m+1))/5)+Y+(Y/4)-(Y/100)+(Y/400))%7
 * 
 * where h is the day of the week (0: Saturday, 1: Sunday, 2: Monday, 3:
 * Tuesday, 4: Wednesday, 5: Thursday, 6: Friday). q is the day of the month. m
 * is the month (3: March, 4: April, ..., 12: December). January and February
 * are counted as months 13 and 14 of the previous year. j is the century
 * (i.e.,). year/100 k is the year of the century (i.e., year % 100).
 * 
 * Note that the division in the formula performs an integer division. Write a
 * pro- gram that prompts the user to enter a year, month, and day of the month,
 * and displays the name of the day of the week. Here are some sample runs:
 * 
 * Enter year: (e.g., 2012): 2015 Enter month: 1-12: 1 Enter the day of the
 * month: 1-31: 25 Day of the week is Sunday
 * 
 * Enter year: (e.g., 2012): 2012 Enter month: 1-12: 5 Enter the day of the
 * month: 1-31: 12 Day of the week is Saturday
 * 
 * (Hint: January and February are counted as 13 and 14 in the formula, so you
 * need to convert the user input 1 to 13 and 2 to 14 for the month and change
 * the year to the previous year.)
