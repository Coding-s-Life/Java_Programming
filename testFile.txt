Hello, I joined Github last week, created and initiated my first two repositories. Now I want to add, commit and push revised files to those repositories. When I pushed the revised files, I received the following response: ----------------------------------------- $ git push fatal: The current branch master has no upstream branch. To push the current branch and set the remote as upstream, use git push --set-upstream origin master ------------------------------------------ So I did, and received response: My Name@DESKTOP-32QET7M TINGS64 ~/Desktop (master) --- (I revised this line, with same type of characters) $ git push --set-upstream origin master fatal: unable to access
